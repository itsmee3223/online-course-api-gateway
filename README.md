Implement an API gateway that is the single entry point for all clients. The API gateway handles requests in one of two ways. Some requests are simply proxied/routed to the appropriate service. It handles other requests by fanning out to multiple services.

Rather than provide a one-size-fits-all style API, the API gateway can expose a different API for each client. For example, the Netflix API gateway runs client-specific adapter code that provides each client with an API thatâ€™s best suited to its requirements.

- The API gateway might also implement security, e.g. verify that the client is authorized to perform the request.
- This Api-Gateway is built using ExpressJS Framework.
